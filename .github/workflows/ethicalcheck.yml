# EthicalCheck addresses the critical need to continuously security test APIs in development and in production.

# EthicalCheck provides the industry's only free & automated API security testing service that uncovers security vulnerabilities using OWASP API list.
# Developers relies on EthicalCheck to evaluate every update and release, ensuring that no APIs go to production with exploitable vulnerabilities.

# You develop the application and API, we bring complete and continuous security testing to you, accelerating development.

# Know your API and Applications are secure with EthicalCheck – our free & automated API security testing service.

# How EthicalCheck works?
# EthicalCheck functions in the following simple steps.
# 1. Security Testing.
# Provide your OpenAPI specification or start with a public Postman collection URL.
# EthicalCheck instantly instrospects your API and creates a map of API endpoints for security testing.
# It then automatically creates hundreds of security tests that are non-intrusive to comprehensively and completely test for authentication, authorizations, and OWASP bugs your API. The tests address security vulnerabilities as detailed in OWASP API Security list.

# 2. Reporting.
# EthicalCheck generates security test report that includes all the tested endpoints, coverage graph, exceptions, and vulnerabilities.
# Vulnerabilities are fully triaged, it contains CVSS score, severity, endpoint information, and OWASP tagging.

# This is a starter workflow to help you get started with EthicalCheck Actions
